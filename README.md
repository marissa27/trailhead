# TrailHead

Instead of a dating app for someone you'll probably hang out with once or twice how about an app that lets you look at a photo of a hike! If you have decided to give this hike a deeper look you can go to your favorites and get more info where you will find the hike name, location, if you can bring your pup, a brief description and more.

## Still In Progress

This project is still not where it needs to be. I have used my graphic design background and made the basic icons needed, so far, and imagery for empty pages - like the sad backpack based off my own backpacking pack.

Through this project I have been learning and am continuing to learn the power of React/Redux. Although I still haven't found an API that works for my app I do have a Node.js backend that I mocked out 11 hikes in.

### Coming Up!

Moving forward I would like to have my hiking cards be swipeable for if they are favorited or not by the user. I am also pairing with someone in the backend program at my school to work on setting up a backend that grabs the info we need and expands the app through:
* Letting the user put in their zip code and pulling hikes around them
* having a user sign in so their favorites are saved
* allow ratings of hikes
* a place that shows completed hikes
* more imagery for the hikes
